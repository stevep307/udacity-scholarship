			<p class="fact">Snow leopard's tails are almost as long as they are, helping them to maintain their balance.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Binomial name</span>: panthera uncia</li>
				<li><span>Height</span>: 55 – 65 cm (22 – 26 inches)</li>
				<li><span>Length</span>: 90 – 115 cm (36 – 44 inches)</li>
				<li><span>Habitats</span>: rocky, broken terrain</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Snow leopards have long, thick fur, and their base color varies from smoky gray to yellowish, with whitish underparts. Their wide, fur-covered feet act as natural snowshoes. They use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill. Its hind legs give the snow leopard the ability to leap six times the length of its body. They are gorgeous but their population is dropping.</p>
