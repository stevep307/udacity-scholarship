## How to run and maintain the application

To run the application open **index.html** file from project root in your browser.

To implement new features use "test-driven development" practice. Jasmine framework included in a project. Explore the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io). Write tests first before start developing a new feature. Find out which tests are failing and then start to write a code to make these tests pass.

## Implementation details
